# msw-testing

This project was bootstrapped with [*create-react-app*](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It's purpose is to test out the [mock-service-worker](https://mswjs.io) library, which allows developers to stub out http requests, and write client-side code easily, without the need of a backend service.

Utilized in this project is, Kent C. Dodds' [bookshelf](https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf) project, a great resource to follow great patterns.
